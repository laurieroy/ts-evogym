# EVOGYM - evolutionary fitness website frontend

This was built following a [code-along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2NNxr3WPDo) from Ed Roh.

- UI: React with TailwindCSS with HeroIcons, React Anchor Link smooth scroll
- animations: Framer motion
- form: react-hook-form 
- form submission handled by: [FORMSUBMIT](formsubmit.co)

### My thoughts
This was a fun tutorial, I learned more on animation and flex. There are a few things with Tailwind that I'm still fuzzy on, extracting code out to a component or custom variable. I'm sure this could be prettied up a bit. 

I would also like to implement smooth-scroll with tailwind.
